<div class="nm_post_content"><p>Some time ago Usurper v0.24 was released, and I forgot to add a news entry!</p>
<p>Maybe that's for the better, because today I just updated the v0.24 release with some new binaries.&nbsp; The original release didn't come with MS-DOS EXE/OVR files, but this one does.&nbsp; And the original one had buggy Linux binaries, while this one has some of those bugs fixed.</p>
<p>I probably should have bumped to v0.24a or something, but I was too lazy, so if you downloaded v0.24 before Nov 20 2015, try downloading it again.</p>

<div class="nm_post_content"><p>Did the Windows port of Usurper crash on you during dungeon fights? First off, why didn't you tell me?!?! Secondly, a fix is now available on the <a href="#/downloads/">Usurper</a> page. The same problem may exist in other places and is impossible to find via a search/replace mechanism, so <a href="#/contact">please report any other crashes</a> you may encounter!</p>

<div class="nm_post_content"><p>Several months ago the author of Usurper released the source code under the GNU GPL license. Shortly after I compiled a quick and dirty Win32 port, but it wasn't really done properly at all, so this past weekend I sat down and did a proper port and have now <a href="#/downloads/">released v0.21</a>.</p>
