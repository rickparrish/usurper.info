Some time ago Usurper v0.24 was released, and I forgot to add a news entry!

Maybe that's for the better, because today I just updated the v0.24 release with some new binaries.  The original release didn't come with MS-DOS EXE/OVR files, but this one does.  And the original one had buggy Linux binaries, while this one has some of those bugs fixed.

I probably should have bumped to v0.24a or something, but I was too lazy, so if you downloaded v0.24 before Nov 20 2015, try downloading it again.
