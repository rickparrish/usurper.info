<h2>About Usurper</h2>
<p>Welcome to Usurper, a fantasy game filled with fast paced action, violence and instant death. This game has only one purpose : to give you a good time without the need of reading any lengthy documentation. You can actually enter the game and go berzerk straight away. However, you can consider continuing to read and perhaps learn something that can keep you alive for a while.</p>
<p>You can choose to play as a lonewolf adventurer/warrior who seek gain only for yourself, and care little for anything else. You can also form teams in which you and your comrades fight for each other. In either case you should always concentrate your efforts on the dungeons. It's in these huge cave areas that your fortune can be made, or your life end... There are over one hundred dungeons stretching from the top of the huge mountain, down to it's deepest level. It may be said at once that no creature has ever returned from the deeper levels. The ancient legends say that on Durunghins bottom there is a "thing" so powerful that the worlds destiny can be altered with it. But the legends also say that the guardians of this "thing" goes beyond everything your worst nightmares can bring forth... Well, no one has ever reached beyond the magic 90th level--you might be the first. You can take your team with you to the dungeons. It is almost always better to have more than one to face those monsters.</p>
<p>Completing the final challenge at the bottom of the huge mountain will reward you with immortalization in the chronicles. Your name will live forever.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in the dungeons, many strange creatures lurk around. Some will eventually approach you and offer different things. Your response will ultimately lead to either riches or to death...</p>
<p>If you don't fancy strolling down the dungeons, you can do other things. You can visit the Dormitory, where many of the characters take their rest. You can kick them out of their beds and challenge them for a fight, or perhaps try to murder them while they sleep...</p>
