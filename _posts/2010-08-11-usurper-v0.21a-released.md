Did the Windows port of Usurper crash on you during dungeon fights? First off, why didn't you tell me?!?! Secondly, a fix is now available on the Usurper page. 

The same problem may exist in other places and is impossible to find via a search/replace mechanism, so please report any other crashes you may encounter!
